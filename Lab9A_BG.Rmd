# Regular Expressions through `stringr`
This weeks lab focuses on regular expressions, specifically as implemented throught the *Tidyverse* `stringr` package. The assignment covers transferring all the examples (modified from the Strings Chapter in Hadley Wickham's R for Data Science book) into Markdown and completing the first example from each exercise set.

# 14.3 Matching patterns with regular expressions
```{r load_packages}
library(stringr)
library(tidyverse)
```

## 14.3.1 Basic matches
Simple patterns match exact strings. Consider the following example:
```{r simple_string}
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_view(x, "an")
```
The next step up in complexity is `.`, which matches any character (except a newline):
Here are two examples:
```{r}
str_view(x, ".a.")
```
```{r}
str_view(x, "p.")
```
Note that this only shows the first match in a string.
But if “`.`” matches any character, how do you match the character “`.`”? You need to use an “escape” to tell the regular expression you want to match it exactly, not use its special behaviour. Like strings, regexps use the backslash,`\`, to escape special behaviour. So to match an `.`, you need the regexp `\`.. Unfortunately this creates a problem. We use strings to represent regular expressions, and `\` is also used as an escape symbol in strings. So to create the regular expression `\`. we need the string "`\\.`". 
```{r}
# To create the regular expression, we need \\
dot <- "\\."

# But the expression itself only contains one:
writeLines(dot)
```
```{r}
# And this tells R to look for an explicit .
x <- c("abc", "a.c", "bef")
str_view(x, "a\\.c")
```
If `\`is used as an escape character in regular expressions, how do you match a literal `\`? Well you need to escape it, creating the regular expression `\\`. To create that regular expression, you need to use a string, which also needs to escape `\`. That means to match a literal `\` you need to write `"\\\\"` — you need four backslashes to match one!
```{r}
x <- "a\\b"
writeLines(x)
```
```{r}
str_view(x, "\\\\")
```
In this book, I’ll write regular expression as `.` and strings that represent the regular expression as `"\\."`.

### 14.3.1.1 Exercises
1. Explain why each of these strings don’t match a \: "\", "\\", "\\\".
ANSWER: The behaviors are predicated on the behavior of escaping characters and generating regular expressions in R. So, `"\"` escapes the next character in the R string, while `"\\"` escapes the next character in the regular expression. So if the first two get us tothe point of being able to escape something in a regular expression, the third tells us exactly that, that the backslash that follows `"\\\" will be what we are looking for.

## 14.3.2 Anchors (aweigh!)
By default, regular expressions will match any part of a string. It’s often useful to anchor the regular expression so that it matches from the start or end of the string. You can use:

+ `^` to match the start of the string.
+ `$` to match the end of the string.

```{r}
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_view(x, "^a")
```
```{r}
str_view(x, "a$")
```
To remember which is which, try this mnemonic which I learned from Evan Misshula: if you begin with power (`^`), you end up with money (`$`).

To force a regular expression to only match a complete string, anchor it with both `^` and `$`:
```{r}
x <- c("apple pie", "apple", "apple cake")
str_view(x, "apple")
```
```{r}
str_view(x, "^apple$")
```
You can also match the boundary between words with `\b`. I don’t often use this in R, but I will sometimes use it when I’m doing a search in RStudio when I want to find the name of a function that’s a component of other functions. For example, I’ll search for `\bsum\b` to avoid matching summarise, summary, rowsum and so on.

### 14.3.2.1 Exercises
1. How would you match the literal string `"$^$"`?
ANSWER: I believe you would have to use backslashes to escape the special function?
```{r}
x <- c("$^$")
str_view(x, "\\$^$")
```
But the answer key does a better job of expaining what the question was actually asking and shows that I was right about the backslashes, especially when trying to avoid partial matches.
```{r}
str_view(c("$^$", "ab$^$sfas"), "^\\$\\^\\$$", match = TRUE)
```

## 14.3.3 Character classes and alternatives
There are a number of special patterns that match more than one character. You’ve already seen ., which matches any character apart from a newline. There are four other useful tools:

`\d` : matches any digit.
`\s` : matches any whitespace (e.g. space, tab, newline).
`[abc]` : matches a, b, or c.
`[^abc]` : matches anything except a, b, or c.
Remember, to create a regular expression containing `\d` or `\s`, you’ll need to escape the `\` for the string, so you’ll type `"\\d"` or `"\\s"`.

A character class containing a single character is a nice alternative to backslash escapes when you want to include a single metacharacter in a regex. Many people find this more readable.
```{r}
# Look for a literal character that normally has special meaning in a regex
x <- c("abc", "a.c", "a*c", "a c")
str_view(x, "a[.]c")
```
```{r}
str_view(x, ".[*]c") #this one looks for any character then "*", then "c"
```
```{r}
str_view(x, "a[ ]") #this one looks for "a" then a space
```
This works for most (but not all) regex metacharacters: `$` `.` `|` `?` `*` `+` `(` `)` `[` `{`. Unfortunately, a few characters have special meaning even inside a character class and must be handled with backslash escapes: `]` `\` `^` and `-`.

You can use alternation to pick between one or more alternative patterns. For example, `abc|d..f` will match either ‘“abc”’, or “deaf”. Note that the precedence for `|` is low, so that `abc|xyz` matches `abc` or `xyz` not `abcyz` or `abxyz.` Like with mathematical expressions, if precedence ever gets confusing, use parentheses to make it clear what you want:
```{r}
x <- c("grey", "gray")
str_view(x, "gr(e|a)y")
```
### 14.3.3.1 Exercises
For this exercise I made test code using the common words in stringr:words
1. Create regular expressions to find all words that:
+ Start with a vowel:
```{r}
x <- stringr::words
str_view(x,"^[aeiou]", match = TRUE)
#or 
str_subset(x,"^[aeiou]")
```
str_subset is better here as it only shows the selected words.

+ That contain only consonants (I had to google this! I messed around using  `!` at first since that was the logical R thing?):
```{r}
str_subset(x,"[aeiou]", negate=TRUE)
```

+ End with `ed` but not `eed`:
```{r}
str_subset(x, "[^e]ed$")
```

+ Ending with `ing` or `ise`:
```{r}
str_subset(x, "ing|ise$") 
```

## 14.3.4 Repetition
The next step up in power involves controlling how many times a pattern matches:

+ `?`: 0 or 1
+ `+`: 1 or more
+ `*`: 0 or more
```{r}
x <- "1888 is the longest year in Roman numerals: MDCCCLXXXVIII"
str_view(x, "CC?")
```
```{r}
str_view(x, "CC+")
```
```{r}
str_view(x, 'C[LX]+')
```
I am still having a little bit of a hard time understanding the behavior of that last one so I ran it this way to try to figure it out
```{r}
str_view(x, 'C[LX]')
```
which was helpful because now I realize that it was saying "look for C followed by L or X" and the `+` was saying to look for L or X in sequence.

Note that the precedence of these operators is high, so you can write: `colou?r` to match either American or British spellings. That means most uses will need parentheses, like `bana(na)+`.

You can also specify the number of matches precisely:

`{n}`: exactly n
`{n,}`: n or more
`{,m}`: at most m
`{n,m}`: between n and m
```{r}
str_view(x, "C{2}")
```
```{r}
str_view(x, "C{2,}")
```
By default these matches are “greedy”: they will match the longest string possible. You can make them “lazy”, matching the shortest string possible by putting a `?` after them. This is an advanced feature of regular expressions, but it’s useful to know that it exists:
```{r}
str_view(x, 'C{2,3}?')
```
```{r}
str_view(x, 'C[LX]+?')
```
### 14.3.4.1 Exercises

1. Describe the equivalents of ?, +, * in {m,n} form.

  + The equivalent of `?`: {0,1}
```{r}
str_view(x,"CC?")
str_view(x,"CC{0,1}")
```
  
  + The equivalent of `+`: {1,}
```{r}
str_view(x,"CC+")
str_view(x,"CC{1,}")
```
  
  + The equivalent of `*`: {0,}
```{r}
str_view(x,"CC*")
str_view(x,"CC{0,}")
```

## 14.3.5 Grouping and backreferences
Earlier, you learned about parentheses as a way to disambiguate complex expressions. Parentheses also create a numbered capturing group (number 1, 2 etc.). A capturing group stores the part of the string matched by the part of the regular expression inside the parentheses. You can refer to the same text as previously matched by a capturing group with backreferences, like `\1`, `\2` etc. For example, the following regular expression finds all fruits that have a repeated pair of letters.
```{r}
str_view(fruit, "(..)\\1", match = TRUE)
```
(Shortly, you’ll also see how they’re useful in conjunction with `str_match()`.)

### 14.3.5.1 Exercises
Ok, I am going to be upfront here! I completely don't get the logic and syntax here. I pretty much just had to look at the answer for at least the first sub-question because with such a limited discussion and 1 example I could not really understand what the heck the code was doing or how the logic played out. There is no real expalnations of *backraferences* or links so how the heck do we know the difference between `\2` or `\1`?
1. Describe, in words, what these expressions will match:

+ `"(.)\1\1"`: 
```{r}
str_view(fruit, "(.)\1\1", match = TRUE)
```
This produces no matches from the list in fruit. Looking at the answer I now see the logic in that the `(.)` denotes any character 1x and the `\1` repeated twice leads to 3x. However, now I am confused by the single `\` as opposed to the double. Indeed, 
```{r}
str_view(c("aaa"), "(.)\1\1")
```
yields no match, while
```{r}
str_view(c("aaa"), "(.)\\1\\1")
```
So is this a typo???? 

+ `"(.)(.)\\2\\1"`:
I am not really sure what the 2 is as it was never explained? the 1 suggests 2 characters repeated...The answer key says a pair of characters followed by the same pair of characters in reverse order. Let's test
```{r}
str_view(c("deeded"),"(.)(.)\\2\\1")
```
Ok I googled this and now I understand. Thanks, stackoverflow. 

+ `(..)\1`:two characters repeated, I actually understood this one! However still have the single vs. double `\` issue?
```{r}
str_view(c("dodo"),"(..)\1")
```
```{r}
str_view(c("dodo"),"(..)\\1")
```

+ `"(.).\\1.\\1"`: My buest guess here was two characters repeated, a random character, then the repeat again? Let's try...
```{r}
str_view(c("AAAAbAA"),"(.).\\1.\\1")
```
Close! So it matches 3 characters then a break, then the character again? Close, turns out the second character does not have to be the same as the first, third, and fifth (original character).

+ `"(.)(.)(.).*\\3\\2\\1"`: Ok, I think this would match ABCDCBA, so 3 characters, a random character, then the orignal sequence reversed?
```{r}
str_view(c("ABCDCBA"),"(.)(.)(.).*\\3\\2\\1")
```
Yes!

# 14.4 Tools
Now that you’ve learned the basics of regular expressions, it’s time to learn how to apply them to real problems. In this section you’ll learn a wide array of stringr functions that let you:

+Determine which strings match a pattern.
+Find the positions of matches.
+Extract the content of matches.
+Replace matches with new values.
+Split a string based on a match.

## 14.4.1 Detect matches
+ Note the below takes advantage of the built in `word` vector that is loaded with the `stringr` library.
To determine if a character vector matches a pattern, use `str_detect()`. It returns a logical vector the same length as the input:
```{r}
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_detect(x, "e")
```
Remember that when you use a logical vector in a numeric context, `FALSE` becomes 0 and `TRUE` becomes 1. That makes `sum()` and `mean()` useful if you want to answer questions about matches across a larger vector:
```{r}
# How many common words start with t?
sum(str_detect(words, "^t"))
```
What proportion of common words end with a vowel?
```{r}
mean(str_detect(words, "[aeiou]$"))
```
When you have complex logical conditions (e.g. match a or b but not c unless d) it’s often easier to combine multiple `str_detect()` calls with logical operators, rather than trying to create a single regular expression. For example, here are two ways to find all words that don’t contain any vowels:
```{r}
# Find all words containing at least one vowel, and negate
no_vowels_1 <- !str_detect(words, "[aeiou]")
```
```{r}
# Find all words consisting only of consonants (non-vowels)
no_vowels_2 <- str_detect(words, "^[^aeiou]+$")
identical(no_vowels_1, no_vowels_2)
```
The results are identical, but I think the first approach is significantly easier to understand. If your regular expression gets overly complicated, try breaking it up into smaller pieces, giving each piece a name, and then combining the pieces with logical operations.

A common use of `str_detect()` is to select the elements that match a pattern. You can do this with logical subsetting, or the convenient `str_subset()` wrapper:
```{r}
words[str_detect(words, "x$")]
```
```{r}
str_subset(words, "x$")
```
Typically, however, your strings will be one column of a data frame, and you’ll want to use filter instead:
```{r}
df <- tibble(
  word = words, 
  i = seq_along(word)
)
df %>% 
  filter(str_detect(word, "x$"))
```
A variation on `str_detect()` is `str_count()`: rather than a simple yes or no, it tells you how many matches there are in a string:
```{r}
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_count(x, "a")
```
```{r}
# On average, how many vowels per word?
mean(str_count(words, "[aeiou]"))
```
It’s natural to use `str_count()` with `mutate()`:
```{r}
df %>% 
  mutate(
    vowels = str_count(word, "[aeiou]"),
    consonants = str_count(word, "[^aeiou]")
  )
```
Note that matches never overlap. For example, in `"abababa`", how many times will the pattern `"aba"` match? Regular expressions say two, not three:
```{r}
str_count("abababa", "aba")
```
```{r}
str_view_all("abababa", "aba")
```

Note the use of `str_view_all()`. As you’ll shortly learn, many stringr functions come in pairs: one function works with a single match, and the other works with all matches. The second function will have the suffix _all.

### 14.4.1.1 Exercises
1. For each of the following challenges, try solving it by using both a single regular expression, and a combination of multiple str_detect() calls.
+Find all words that start or end with x.
Regex should be:
```{r}
str_subset(words, "^x|x$")
```
Combination of multiple `str_detect` calls:
```{r}
start <- str_detect(words,"^x")
end <- str_detect(words,"x$")
words[start|end]
```

+ Find all words that start with a vowel and end with a consonant.

Regex:
```{r}
str_subset(words,"^[aeiou] & [^aeiou]$")
```
hmmmm, ok. Apaprently boolean won't work like that here.
```{r}
str_subset(words,"^[aeiou].*[^aeiou]$")
```
Now let's try multiple ``string_detect`s`
```{r}
s_v <- str_detect(words,"^[aeiou]")
e_c <- str_detect(words,"[^aeiou]$")
words[s_v & e_c]
```

+ Are there any words that contain at least one of each different vowel?
Start with regex:
```{r}
str_subset(words,"(a)(e)(i)(o)(u)")
```
hmmmmmm that was pure guess and I think it says find them in that order. And can't figure it out. OH LOOK, a trick question. You can't do it with a regular expression. 
How about multiple `string_detect`s
```{r}
words[str_detect(words, "a") &
        str_detect(words, "e") &
        str_detect(words, "i") &
        str_detect(words, "o") &
        str_detect(words, "u") ]
```
And the answer is zero.

## 14.4.2 Extract matches
To extract the actual text of a match, use `str_extract()`. To show that off, we’re going to need a more complicated example. I’m going to use the Harvard sentences, which were designed to test VOIP systems, but are also useful for practicing regexps. These are provided in `stringr::sentence`s:
```{r}
length(sentences)
```
```{r}
head(sentences)
```
Imagine we want to find all sentences that contain a colour. We first create a vector of colour names, and then turn it into a single regular expression:
```{r}
colours <- c("red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "purple")
colour_match <- str_c(colours, collapse = "|")
colour_match
```
Now we can select the sentences that contain a colour, and then extract the colour to figure out which one it is:
```{r}
has_colour <- str_subset(sentences, colour_match)
matches <- str_extract(has_colour, colour_match)
head(matches)
```
+ The above example has an error.
```{r}
head(has_colour)
```
Can your spot the issue with the regular expression?
*It sure seems like a lot of sentences without colors? And some sentences have colors that were not in `coulour_match`*

Note that str_extract() only extracts the first match. We can see that most easily by first selecting all the sentences that have more than 1 match:
```{r}
more <- sentences[str_count(sentences, colour_match) > 1]
str_view_all(more, colour_match)
```
ah-ha! And now it makes sense.
```{r}
str_extract(more, colour_match)
```
This is a common pattern for stringr functions, because working with a single match allows you to use much simpler data structures. To get all matches, use str_extract_all(). It returns a list:
```{r}
str_extract_all(more, colour_match)
```
You’ll learn more about lists in lists and iteration.

If you use `simplify = TRUE`, `str_extract_all()` will return a matrix with short matches expanded to the same length as the longest:
```{r}
str_extract_all(more, colour_match, simplify = TRUE)
```
```{r}
x <- c("a", "a b", "a b c")
str_extract_all(x, "[a-z]", simplify = TRUE)
```
### 14.4.2.1 Exercises
1. In the previous example, you might have noticed that the regular expression matched “flickered”, which is not a colour. Modify the regex to fix the problem.
```{r}
has_colour <- str_subset(sentences, "\\b(red|orange|yellow|green|blue|purple)\\b")
matches <- str_extract(has_colour, colour_match)
head(has_colour)
head(matches)
```

## 14.4.3 Grouped matches
Earlier in this chapter we talked about the use of parentheses for clarifying precedence and for backreferences when matching. You can also use parentheses to extract parts of a complex match. For example, imagine we want to extract nouns from the sentences. As a heuristic, we’ll look for any word that comes after “a” or “the”. Defining a “word” in a regular expression is a little tricky, so here I use a simple approximation: a sequence of at least one character that isn’t a space.
```{r}
noun <- "(a|the) ([^ ]+)"

has_noun <- sentences %>%
  str_subset(noun) %>%
  head(10)
has_noun %>% 
  str_extract(noun)
```
`str_extract()` gives us the complete match; `str_match()` gives each individual component. Instead of a character vector, it returns a matrix, with one column for the complete match followed by one column for each group:
```{r}
has_noun %>% 
  str_match(noun)
```
(Unsurprisingly, our heuristic for detecting nouns is poor, and also picks up adjectives like smooth and parked.)

If your data is in a tibble, it’s often easier to use `tidyr::extract()`. It works like `str_match()` but requires you to name the matches, which are then placed in new columns:
```{r}
tibble(sentence = sentences) %>% 
  tidyr::extract(
    sentence, c("article", "noun"), "(a|the) ([^ ]+)", 
    remove = FALSE
  )
```
Like str_extract(), if you want all matches for each string, you’ll need str_match_all().
### 14.4.3.1 Exercises
1. Find all words that come after a “number” like “one”, “two”, “three” etc. Pull out both the number and the word.
```{r}
task <- "\\b(one|two|three|four|five|six|seven|eight|nine|ten)\\b ([^ ]+)"
has_numbs <- str_subset(sentences, task)
str_match(has_numbs, task)
 
```

## 14.4.4 Replacing matches
`str_replace()` and `str_replace_all()` allow you to replace matches with new strings. The simplest use is to replace a pattern with a fixed string:
```{r}
x <- c("apple", "pear", "banana")
str_replace(x, "[aeiou]", "-")
```
```{r}
str_replace_all(x, "[aeiou]", "-")
```
With str_replace_all() you can perform multiple replacements by supplying a named vector:
```{r}
x <- c("1 house", "2 cars", "3 people")
str_replace_all(x, c("1" = "one", "2" = "two", "3" = "three"))
```
Instead of replacing with a fixed string you can use backreferences to insert components of the match. In the following code, I flip the order of the second and third words.
```{r}
sentences %>% 
  str_replace("([^ ]+) ([^ ]+) ([^ ]+)", "\\1 \\3 \\2") %>% 
  head(5)
```
### 14.4.4.1 Exercises
1. Replace all forward slashes in a string with backslashes. (I hate this exercise already)
```{r}
x <- c("/I", "/hate", "/this", "/already")
str_replace_all(x, "/", "\\\\" )

```
At least I got it right on the first try.

## 14.4.5 Splitting
Use `str_split()` to split a string up into pieces. For example, we could split sentences into words:
```{r}
sentences %>%
  head(5) %>% 
  str_split(" ")
```
Because each component might contain a different number of pieces, this returns a list. If you’re working with a length-1 vector, the easiest thing is to just extract the first element of the list:
```{r}
"a|b|c|d" %>% 
  str_split("\\|") %>% 
  .[[1]]
```
Otherwise, like the other stringr functions that return a list, you can use simplify = TRUE to return a matrix:
```{r}
sentences %>%
  head(5) %>% 
  str_split(" ", simplify = TRUE)
```
You can also request a maximum number of pieces:
```{r}
fields <- c("Name: Hadley", "Country: NZ", "Age: 35")
fields %>% str_split(": ", n = 2, simplify = TRUE)
```
Instead of splitting up strings by patterns, you can also split up by character, line, sentence and word `boundary()`s:
```{r}
x <- "This is a sentence.  This is another sentence."
str_view_all(x, boundary("word"))
```
```{r}
str_split(x, " ")[[1]]
```
```{r}
str_split(x, boundary("word"))[[1]]
```
### 14.4.5.1 Exercises
1. Split up a string like “apples, pears, and bananas” into individual components.
```{r}
x <- "I like to eat, eat, apples and bananas"
str_split(x, boundary("word"))[[1]]
```
